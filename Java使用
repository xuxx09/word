ust ran into this problem running mahout from CDH4 in standalone mode in my MacBook Air.

The issue is that a /tmp/hadoop-xxx/xxx/LICENSE file and a /tmp/hadoop-xxx/xxx/license directory are being created on a case-insensitive file system when unjarring the mahout jobs.

I was able to workaround this by deleting META-INF/LICENSE from the jar file like this:

zip -d mahout-examples-0.6-cdh4.0.0-job.jar META-INF/LICENSE
and then verified it with

jar tvf mahout-examples-0.6-cdh4.0.0-job.jar | grep -i license
Hope this helps!

git reset --hard origin/master
says: throw away all my staged and unstaged changes, forget everything on my current local branch and make it exactly the same as origin/master.

You probably wanted to ask this before you ran the command. The destructive nature is hinted at by using the same words as in "hard reset".

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7929369/how-to-rebase-local-branch-with-remote-master
First fetch the new master from the upstream repository, then rebase your work branch on that:

git fetch origin            # Updates origin/master
git rebase origin/master    # Rebases current branch onto origin/master
Update: Please see Paul Draper's answer for a more concise way to do the same - recent Git versions provide a simpler way to do the equivalent of the above two commands.
